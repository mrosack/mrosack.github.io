Over 4 years since I touched this site, either I'm busy or I don't really have anything interesting to say, I'll let you decide which.  In any case, I decided to get rid of my Wordpress site that I threw up quickly when I went independent and wanted to switch to something more "developery" for my blog.  Hello, Hugo!

Even though I haven't worked much on .NET in a while, I'm still a sucker for Windows for some reason.  So of course there were some hurdles I had to jump through getting my Hugo dev environment set up, mostly because I wanted to use Docker and not actually download the Hugo binary.

Running Hugo in Windows/Docker

- script to start hugo
- watch for changes with polling

Mike Rosack has loved computers and technology his entire life, and getting into software development was a pretty easy career choice.  He grew up in Florida, went to school at Georgia Tech (go Jackets!), and has lived in Wisconsin for well over a decade now.

Mike is passionate about the newest technologies and figuring out how to apply them to make better and better software.  Heâ€™s been working in the field for 15 years now, and still has the same drive to learn as when he first started.

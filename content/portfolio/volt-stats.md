Volt Stats was born in 2011 after I got my Chevy Volt - It interfaced with GM plug-in electric cars (such as the Chevy Volt and Bolt) through Onstar, allowing users to track their driving efficiency, record personal records and achievements, and compete with other users to see who could get the most bang out of their watts!  I retired the site in 2021, but an archival version is still up at http://www.voltstats.net/ if you want to take a look!
